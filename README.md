## 1. General Information

Duplicated source code blocks can harm maintainability of software systems.
Duplo is a tool to find duplicated code blocks in large code bases. Duplo has
special support for some programming languages, meaning it can filter out
(multi-line) comments and compiler directives. For example: C, C++, Java, C#,
and VB.NET. Any other text format is also supported.

## 2. Maintainer

Duplo was originally developed by Christian M. Ammann and is now maintained and
developed by Daniel LidstrÃ¶m.

## 3. File Format Support

Duplo has built in support for the following
file formats:

- C/C++ (.c, .cpp, .cxx, .h, .hpp)
- Java
- C#
- VB
- GCC assembly
- Ada

This means that Duplo will remove preprocessor directives, block comments, using
statements, etc, to only consider duplicates in actual code. In addition, Duplo
can be used as a general (without special support) duplicates detector in
arbitrary text files and will even detect duplicates found in the same file.

Sample output snippet:

```txt
...
src\engine\geometry\simple\TorusGeometry.cpp(56)
src\engine\geometry\simple\SphereGeometry.cpp(54)
    pBuffer[currentIndex*size+3]=(i+1)/(float)subdsU;
    pBuffer[currentIndex*size+4]=j/(float)subdsV;
    currentIndex++;
    pPrimitiveBuffer->unlock();

src\engine\geometry\subds\SubDsGeometry.cpp(37)
src\engine\geometry\SkinnedMeshGeometry.cpp(45)
    pBuffer[i*size+0]=m_ct[0]->m_pColors[i*3];
    pBuffer[i*size+1]=m_ct[0]->m_pColors[i*3+1];
    pBuffer[i*size+2]=m_ct[0]->m_pColors[i*3+2];
...
```

## 4. Installation

### 4.1. Pre-built binaries

Duplo is also available as a pre-built binary for (Alpine) Linux, macOS and
Windows. Grab the executable from the
[releases](https://github.com/dlidstrom/Duplo/releases) page.

You can of course build from source as well.

## 5. Usage

Duplo works with a list of files. You can either specify a file that contains
the list of files, or you can pass them using `stdin`.

Run `duplo --help` on the command line to see the detailed options.

### 5.1. Passing files using `stdin`

In each of the following commands, `duplo` will write the duplicated blocks into
`out.txt` in addition to the information written to stdout.

#### 5.1.1. Bash

```bash
# unix
> find . -type f \( -iname "*.cpp" -o -iname "*.h" \) | duplo - out.txt
```

Let's break this down. `find . -type f \( -iname "*.cpp" -o -iname "*.h" \)` is
a syntax to look recursively in the current directory (the `.` part) for files
(the `-type f` part) matching `*.cpp` or `*.h` (case insensitive). The output
from `find` is piped into `duplo` which then reads the filenames from `stdin`
(the `-` tells `duplo` to get the filenames from `stdin`, a common unix
convention in many commandline applications). The result of the analysis is then
written to `out.txt`.

#### 5.1.2. Windows

```PowerShell
# windows
> Get-ChildItem -Include "*.cpp", "*.h" -Recurse | % { $_.FullName } | Duplo.exe - out.txt
```

This works similarly to the Bash command, but uses PowerShell commands to
achieve the same effect.

### 5.2. Passing files using file

`duplo` can analyze files specified in a separate file:

```bash
# unix
> find . -type f \( -iname "*.cpp" -o -iname "*.h" \) > files.lst
> duplo files.lst out.txt

# windows
> Get-ChildItem -Include "*.cpp", "*.h" -Recurse |  % { $_.FullName } | Out-File -encoding ascii files.lst
> Duplo.exe files.lst out.txt
```

Again, the duplicated blocks are written to `out.txt`.

### 5.3. Json output

Using `-json <filename>` you can output the result as json. This may be useful
if you want to process the result further.

### 5.4. Xml output

Duplo can also output xml and there is a stylesheet that will format the result
for viewing in a browser. This can be used as a report tab in your continuous
integration tool (GitHub Actions, TeamCity, etc).

## 6. Feedback and Bug Reporting

Please open an issue to discuss feedback, feature requests and bug reports.

## 7. Algorithm Background

Duplo uses the same techniques as Duploc to detect duplicated code blocks. See
[Duca99bCodeDuplication](http://scg.unibe.ch/archive/papers/Duca99bCodeDuplication.pdf)
for further information.

### 7.1. Performance Measurements

| System | Files | Loc's | Time |
|-|-|-|-|
| Quake2 | 266 | 102740 | 9sec |

This was measured on modern hardware anno 2025. It means Duplo is able to
process more than 10 thousand lines of code (or ~30 files) per second.

## 8. Developing

### 8.1. Unix

You need `CMake` and preferrably `fswatch` for the best experience.

```bash
# build dependencies
/> brew install cmake
/> brew install fswatch
```

Compiling is best done using the continuous file watcher:

```bash
# CMake builds in the build folder
/> mkdir build
/> pushd build
build/> cmake ..
# now issue make
build/> make
build/> popd
# continuous build can now be used in root folder
# (needs fswatch)
> ./watch.sh
```

### 8.2. Windows

Use Visual Studio 2022 to open the included solution file (or try `CMake`).

### 8.3. Additional Language Support

Duplo can analyze all text files regardless of format, but it has special
support for some programming languages (C++, C#, Java, for example). This allows
Duplo to improve the duplication detection as it can ignore preprocessor
directives and/or comments.

To implement support for a new language, there are a couple of options:

1. Implement `FileTypeBase` which has support for handling comments and
   preprocessor directives. You just need to decide what is a comment. With this
   option you need to implement a couple of methods, one which is
   `CreateLineFilter`. This is to remove multiline comments. Look at
   `CstyleCommentsFilter` for an example.
2. Implement `IFileType` interface directly. This gives you the most freedom but
   also is the hardest option.

You can see an example of how Java support was added effortlessly. It involves
copying an existing file type implementation and adjusting the lines that should
be filtered and how comments should be removed. Finally, add a few lines in
`FileTypeFactory.cpp` to choose the correct implementation based on the file
extension. Refer to [this commit](https://github.com/dlidstrom/Duplo/commit/320f9474354d41c3b35c178bb4b7f6c667025976) for all the details.

### 8.4. Language Suggestions

- JavaScript (easy, just look at the existing C-based ones)
- Ruby
- Python
- Perl
- PHP
- Rust
- F#
- Scala
- Haskell
- Erlang
- What else?

## 10. Accompanying Software

For a pretty ui you should check out [duploq](https://github.com/duploq/duploq) by [ArsMasiuk](https://github.com/ArsMasiuk):

From duploq's Readme file:

> duploq's approach is a pretty straighforward. First, duploq allows you to
> choose where to look for the duplicates (files or folders). Then it builds
> list of input files and passes it to the Duplo engine together with necessary
> parameters. After the files have been processed, duploq parses Duplo's output
> and visualises the results in easy and intuitive way. Also it provides
> additional statistics information which is not a part of Duplo output.
