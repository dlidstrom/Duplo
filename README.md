## 1. General Information

Duplicated source code blocks can harm maintainability of software systems.
Duplo is a tool to find duplicated code blocks in large code bases. Duplo has
special support for some programming languages, meaning it can filter out
(multi-line) comments and compiler directives. For example: C, C++, Java, C#,
and VB.NET. Any other text format is also supported.

## 2. Maintainer

Duplo was originally developed by Christian M. Ammann and is now maintained and
developed by Daniel LidstrÃ¶m.

## 3. File Format Support

Duplo has built in support for the following
file formats:

- C/C++ (.c, .cpp, .cxx, .h, .hpp)
- Java
- C#
- VB
- GCC assembly
- Ada

This means that Duplo will remove preprocessor directives, block comments, using
statements, etc, to only consider duplicates in actual code. In addition, Duplo
can be used as a general (without special support) duplicates detector in
arbitrary text files and will even detect duplicates found in the same file.

Sample output snippet:

```txt
...
src\engine\geometry\simple\TorusGeometry.cpp(56)
src\engine\geometry\simple\SphereGeometry.cpp(54)
    pBuffer[currentIndex*size+3]=(i+1)/(float)subdsU;
    pBuffer[currentIndex*size+4]=j/(float)subdsV;
    currentIndex++;
    pPrimitiveBuffer->unlock();

src\engine\geometry\subds\SubDsGeometry.cpp(37)
src\engine\geometry\SkinnedMeshGeometry.cpp(45)
    pBuffer[i*size+0]=m_ct[0]->m_pColors[i*3];
    pBuffer[i*size+1]=m_ct[0]->m_pColors[i*3+1];
    pBuffer[i*size+2]=m_ct[0]->m_pColors[i*3+2];
...
```

## 4. Installation

### 4.1. Docker

If you have Docker, the way to run Duplo is to use this command:

```bash
# Docker on unix
> docker run --rm -i -w /src -v $(pwd):/src dlidstrom/duplo
```

This pulls the latest image and runs duplo. Note that you'll have to pipe the
filenames into this command. A complete commandline sample will be shown below.

### 4.2. Pre-built binaries

Duplo is also available as a pre-built binary for (alpine) linux and macos. Grab
the executable from the [releases](https://github.com/dlidstrom/Duplo/releases)
page.

You can of course build from source as well, and you'll have to do so to get a
binary for Windows.

## 5. Usage

Duplo works with a list of files. You can either specify a file that contains
the list of files, or you can pass them using `stdin`.

Run `duplo --help` on the command line to see the detailed options.

### 5.1. Passing files using `stdin`

In each of the following commands, `duplo` will write the duplicated blocks into
`out.txt` in addition to the information written to stdout.

#### 5.1.1. Bash

```bash
# unix
> find . -type f \( -iname "*.cpp" -o -iname "*.h" \) | duplo - out.txt
```

Let's break this down. `find . -type f \( -iname "*.cpp" -o -iname "*.h" \)` is
a syntax to look recursively in the current directory (the `.` part) for files
(the `-type f` part) matching `*.cpp` or `*.h` (case insensitive). The output
from `find` is piped into `duplo` which then reads the filenames from `stdin`
(the `-` tells `duplo` to get the filenames from `stdin`, a common unix
convention in many commandline applications). The result of the analysis is then
written to `out.txt`.

#### 5.1.2. Windows

```bash
# windows
> Get-ChildItem -Include "*.cpp", "*.h" -Recurse | % { $_.FullName } | Duplo.exe - out.txt
```

This works similarly to the Bash command, but uses PowerShell commands to
achieve the same effect.

#### 5.1.3. Docker

```bash
# Docker on unix
> find . -type f \( -iname "*.cpp" -or -iname "*.h" \) | docker run --rm -i -w /src -v $(pwd):/src dlidstrom/duplo - out.txt
```

This command also works in a similar fashion to the Bash command, but instead of
piping into a local `duplo` executable, it will pipe into `duplo` running inside
Docker. This is very convenient as you do not have to install `duplo`
separately. You will have to install Docker though, if you haven't already. That
is a good thing to do anyway, since it opens up a lot of possibilities apart
from running `duplo`.

Again, similarly to the Bash command, this uses `find` to find files in the
current directory, then passes the file list to Docker which will pass it
further into an instance of the latest version of `duplo`. The working directory
in the `duplo` container should be `/src` (that's where the `duplo` executable
is located) and the current path of your host machine will be mapped to `/src`
when the container is running. The `-i` allows `stdin` of your host machine to
be passed into Docker to allow `duplo` to read the filenames. Any parameters to
`duplo` can be placed at the end of the command as you can see `- out.txt` has
been.

### 5.2. Passing files using file

`duplo` can analyze files specified in a separate file:

```bash
# unix
> find . -type f \( -iname "*.cpp" -o -iname "*.h" \) > files.lst
> duplo files.lst out.txt

# windows
> Get-ChildItem -Include "*.cpp", "*.h" -Recurse |  % { $_.FullName } | Out-File -encoding ascii files.lst
> Duplo.exe files.lst out.txt

# Docker on unix
> find . -type f \( -iname "*.cpp" -o -iname "*.h" \) > files.lst
> docker run --rm -i -w /src -v $(pwd):/src dlidstrom/duplo files.lst out.txt
```

Again, the duplicated blocks are written to `out.txt`.

### 5.3. Xml output

Duplo can also output xml and there is a stylesheet that will format the result
for viewing in a browser. This can be used as a report tab in your continuous
integration tool (GitHub Actions, TeamCity, etc).

## 6. Feedback and Bug Reporting

Please open an issue to discuss feedback, feature requests and bug reports.

## 7. Algorithm Background

Duplo uses the same techniques as Duploc to detect duplicated code blocks. See
[Duca99bCodeDuplication](http://scg.unibe.ch/archive/papers/Duca99bCodeDuplication.pdf)
for further information.

### 7.1. Performance Measurements

| System | Files | Loc's | Time |
|-|-|-|-|
| Quake2 | 266 | 102740 | 18sec |

## 8. Developing

### 8.1. Unix

You need `CMake` and preferrably `fswatch` for the best experience.

```bash
# build dependencies
/> brew install cmake
/> brew install fswatch
```

Compiling is best done using the continuous file watcher:

```bash
# CMake builds in the build folder
/> mkdir build
/> pushd build
build/> cmake ..
# now issue make
build/> make
build/> popd
# continuous build can now be used in root folder
# (needs fswatch)
> ./watch.sh
```

### 8.2. Windows

Use Visual Studio 2019 to open the included solution file (or try `CMake`).

### 8.3. Additional Language Support

Duplo can analyze all text files regardless of format, but it has special
support for some programming languages (C++, C#, Java, for example). This allows
Duplo to improve the duplication detection as it can ignore preprocessor
directives and/or comments.

To implement support for a new language, there are a couple of options:

1. Implement `FileTypeBase` which has support for handling comments and
   preprocessor directives. You just need to decide what is a comment. With this
   option you need to implement a couple of methods, one which is
   `CreateLineFilter`. This is to remove multiline comments. Look at
   `CstyleCommentsFilter` for an example.
2. Implement `IFileType` interface directly. This gives you the most freedom but
   also is the hardest option.

You can see an example of how Java support was added effortlessly. It involves
copying an existing file type implementation and adjusting the lines that should
be filtered and how comments should be removed. Finally, add a few lines in
`FileTypeFactory.cpp` to choose the correct implementation based on the file
extension. Refer to [this commit](https://github.com/dlidstrom/Duplo/commit/320f9474354d41c3b35c178bb4b7f6c667025976) for all the details.

### 8.4. Language Suggestions

- JavaScript (easy, just look at the existing C-based ones)
- Ruby
- Python
- Perl
- PHP
- Rust
- F#
- Scala
- Haskell
- Erlang
- What else?
